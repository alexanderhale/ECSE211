# DPM Documentation
Documentation for final DPM project.

Documents written in Markdown, you can find a reference [here](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/).  
A nice markdown editor that supports exporting to PDF: [QOwnNotes](http://www.qownnotes.org/).

Make sure to always write a meaningful commit message everytime you commit something. Also, **ALWAYS** update the change history of the file you modified and change the version number.
