Week 6 Meeting Notes

- difference between integration tests and system test?
	- integration: how to the components work together
	- system: how the robot runs in the competition simulation
- upload original LDD file
- once again: ensure that the situation on any particular day can be replicated

- final instructions:
	- full floor available 5:30 Thursday evening
	- if things don't work on Thursday:
		- don't work all night (don't worry, we won't) - you'll make things worse
	- grading
		- 2-3% of project marks depend on whether robot works
		- 40% of project marks depend on the presentation(s)
			- each presentation is 5-10 minutes presenting, 20 minutes questioning
			- some questions will be dumb, some will be tough, be prepared
			- presentations start at 9:00 - 9:30
			- questions _should_ be dependent on the process
				- teaching and learning people might have some wishy-washy questions
		- 7-8% on weekly meetings and beta demo
		- remaining marks from documentation submission
		- 4 runs on the demo floor
			- marks depend on illustrating all the behaviours required
				- if they get illustrated in different runs, that counts
			- for every behaviour illustrated, you get a point
				- add up the points in each demo
				- robot with most points at the end of the day wins
			- 5 minutes each, 8 hour day, 1 hour for lunch
	- create a checklist
		- charged batteries
		- right hardware and software
		- cables plugged in
		- etc
		- sign off on all these things before the robot is allowed to run
			- prevents people from changing minor things waiting to run
		- hand in a copy with the final documentation submission
	- bring an extension cord or powerbar
- final report
	- will be posted soon
		- 5ish pages
		- what when wrong (in preparation, on the day)
		- what went well
		- what happened during the semester
- final documentation submission on a USB December
	- add a directory file at the front of the USB
	- two copies of the USB, one for each Professor
	- printed copy of the report with everybody's signature on it
		- everybody has to agree with what's written in there and in the documentation submission

- add a clock on the searching algorithm:
	- if you can't find the flag within a time limit, forget it and go back to home base
