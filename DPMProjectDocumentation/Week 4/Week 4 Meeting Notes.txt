Week 4 Notes
- hours worked mark deduction is based on the average
	- missed what the exact calculation was for grade deductions
	- 
- if the WiFi is the only thing left to develop, that's pretty good
- if the hardware is finalized, that's great
	- any changes will require large software changes
- export timesheet as an Excel file so Prof. Lowther can play around with it
- GANTT
	- software dev and testing probably shouldn't be simultaneous
		- can't test it until it's already done
	- make sure tasks in GANTT match tasks in timesheet
		- number of hours doesn't have to be perfect, but be sure you're working on one of the tasks in the chart
		- maybe make explicit references to GANTT tasks in timesheet?
		- use the numbers associated with each task in GANTT and put them in the timesheet
		- team members should look at tasks in GANTT chart to take note of which task they're working on
- testing suggestions
	- Prof. Lowther wants to be able to re-run any one of the tests based on the documentation
	- replace all the N/As with links to the actual code that was used
		- if a custom-written script was used to run the test, make sure to save it and include it in documentation files so he can use it
	- how accurate do we _need_ the sensors to be for our goal to be achieved?
		- we know how accurate all the motors are from the tests that have been completed, but do we know how much inaccuracy we can tolerate?
		- we have time to do this, may as well

- no document upload required next week
	- we can do it anyway to stay on the same rhythm, but they won't be marked
	- the documents will be uploaded in 2 weeks' time for our final meeting, which is the week of the final demo

- flag detection:
	- we're allowed to run into the blocks, but you can't move them out of the square
	- don't move the zip line, y'all
	- the zip line builder might meet with people to discuss changing it
